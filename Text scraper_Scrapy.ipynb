      "On Tuesday influential leaders from around the globe descend in the cold mountainous village of Davos, Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting 2020, held under the theme: Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World, with a focus on renewing the concept of stakeholder capitalism to overcome income inequality, societal division and the climate crisis. The Meeting starts today (21 - 24 Jan), and I will be taking part in some of the scheduled panel discussions such as “Champions for Nature: The road to 2030”, media events, and structured discussions on a range of issues, with specific focus on potential benefits for Botswana’s development agenda.\n",
